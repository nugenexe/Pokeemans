7Next Full-Stack Take-home

Instructions: Please spend no more than 3 hours creating an application using the requested frameworks. 
During your interview, be prepared to walk through the code that you have written, explain design choices, 
and describe challenges that you encountered. There is no expectation that you complete the entire 
challenge – it is intentionally long. We are interested in your coding style, thought process, and ability to communicate. 

Once you’ve finished, please push the code to a public repository and send it to matthew.magee2@7-11.com with 
the subject “[Candidate Name] – 7Next Take-home Repo.”

Most importantly – have fun!
